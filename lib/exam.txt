Exam Regulations Examinations at DIT include continuous assessments (tests, assignments, seminars, presentations, practicals) and final examinations. Key regulations include:





Candidates must pay required fees, register for prescribed modules, complete continuous assessments, and undertake practical training to be eligible for examinations.



Continuous assessment typically constitutes 60% of the final grade, with components like classroom tests (25%), practicals (20%), and assignments (15%). For some modules, it may be 75%.



Absence from examinations without permission results in penalties, such as a fail grade or ineligibility for supplementary exams.



Examination irregularities, such as cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized materials, lead to severe consequences like module cancellation or discontinuation.



A semester GPA of 2.0 or above (3.0 for NTA Level 9) is required to pass, with specific conditions for failing modules or Industrial Practical Training, IPT. Supplementary examinations are capped at the lowest pass grade.



Examination results are approved by the Academic Committee and endorsed by the Council. Appeals are handled by the Academic Appeals Committee.



Progression to the next level requires passing all modules and meeting minimum credit requirements. Degree classifications are based on GPA ranges, with specific score ranges for NTA Levels 4-9 (e.g., A: 70-100 for NTA 4-5, 75-100 for NTA 6).
